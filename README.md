# Virtual Hackathon-LACCEI 2024 
# Low-Consumption Water Quality Monitoring Station
Group Name: ElectroGallos

This project builds a low-power water quality monitoring station that utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect and transmit real-time data to Thingspeak for visualization and further analysis using MATLAB.

## Features
  
  -Low-power operation for remote deployments
 
  -Measures key water quality parameters: pH, ORP, Turbidity, Temperature, and TDS  
 
  -Utilizes Arduino IDE for programming the ESP32
  
  -Transmits data wirelessly to Thingspeak for cloud storage and visualization
 
  -Enables data analysis using Matlab for in-depth insights


## Software Tools

  -Arduino IDE (https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)
  
  -Thingspeak Account (https://thingspeak.com/)
  
  -Matlab Software (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)

## Additional Notes

This README provides a general guideline. Specific code examples and detailed wiring diagrams will depend on your chosen sensor models.

Consider implementing error handling and data validation routines in your code for robustness.

Explore advanced features of Thingspeak and Matlab for data visualization and analysis tailored to your specific needs.

This project provides a starting point for building a low-power water quality monitoring station. By customizing the code, sensor selection, and data analysis techniques, you can create a powerful tool for environmental monitoring and water quality management.

The specific sensor models may vary depending on your preferences and budget. Ensure compatibility with the ESP32 and choose low-power options if extending battery life is crucial.
