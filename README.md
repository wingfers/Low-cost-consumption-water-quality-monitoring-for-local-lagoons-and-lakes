Low-Consumption Water Quality Monitoring Station
This project builds a low-power water quality monitoring station that utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect and transmit real-time data to Thingspeak for visualization and further analysis using Matlab.

Features
  -Low-power operation for remote deployments
  -Measures key water quality parameters: pH, ORP, Turbidity, Temperature, and TDS  
  -Utilizes Arduino IDE for programming the ESP32
  -Transmits data wirelessly to Thingspeak for cloud storage and visualization
  -Enables data analysis using Matlab for in-depth insights

Hardware Components
  -ESP32 Development Board (ESP32­-WROOM­-DA)
  -pH Sensor (analog or digital)
  -ORP Sensor (analog or digital)
  -Turbidity Sensor (analog or digital)
  -Temperature Sensor (e.g., DS18B20)
  -TDS Sensor (analog or digital)
  -PCB Layout and Wiring
  -Power Supply (Battery Pack or Solar Panel with Regulator)
Note: The specific sensor models may vary depending on your preferences and budget. Ensure compatibility with the ESP32 and choose low-power options if extending battery life is crucial.
